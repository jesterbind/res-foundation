        <p>Transcription of “RES” - Temporarily classified.</p>
        <p>RES Foundation – known for most of the governments, but classified from society Foundation, dealing with the
            unexplainable by laws of physics mystery and anomalous of our World, by capturing, securing,
            destroying or containing them. The deed started by Ulysses, the founder of Foundation, is goes on
            since 19th century till today.
        </p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>
            There are terms, that writers of RES, as everyone who work here use in documents:</p>
        <p>CF-Class – Class of employees, which is mostly forced to be a subject in experiments with anomalous
            objects. They are convicted criminals taken from prisons all over the world, because of that they do
            not get paid for their job.</p>
        <p>Every member of CF-Class does have a number by which they are distinguished. There are two types
            of number:</p>
        <p>Short-term number – CF-Class member gets when he only got to Foundation facility and have not
            participated in any experiments. Example of short-term number – CF-123456NP (Numbers are
            always random; NP – Non-participant). They will get another type of number right after any
            researcher will sign member up for an experiment.
        </p>
        <p>CF-Number – CF-Class member will get right after any researcher sign member up for an experiment.
            Independently on subsequent experiments, “CF-member” is number will not change. Example of CF-Number –
            CF-123456 (First 3 numbers depends on which anomalous object was member signed up.
            Last 3 numbers depend on member is queue).</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Researchers – a big part of RES workers, whose task is studying all contained objects, discover,
            research, and document their anomalous effects, designing various devices and medical products. All
            researchers must be in a white lab coat, while they are in RES Facility.</p>
        <p>Senior Researchers – a high-ranking researcher, most often the senior researcher does the same
            thing as a regular researcher, but they are responsible for developing countermeasures in
            containment breaches and have more experience with objects.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Janitors – they clean halls, offices, some of the safe object is containment chambers. The dangerous
            chambers clean CF-Class workers, but of course, with safety measures.
        </p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Security Officers – guards of RES Facilities, are tasked with maintaining physical security for
            Foundation projects, operations, and personnel. Especially drawn from military, law enforcement
            and trained to use of any types of weapons to cover containment breaches as well as hostile actions.
            Each Area and Site have their own security officers.
        </p>
        <p>Senior Security Officers – are highly trained and responsible for contingency planes in any
            emergency situations, such as containment breach incidents, operations inside and outside of
            Facilities. Rated higher than regular security officers.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>RES Task Forces – are elite unites mobilized to deal with specific threats or situations that exceed the
            operational capacity or expertise of security officers. They may be relocated between facilities and
            locations as needed. Each “RTF” have their unique name and based on first mission they have done.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Area Directors – are responsible for their Area, they do work. They oversee and control the
            operations of every personnel, their security, containment conditions, come up with strategies. They
            manage the Foundation is presence in their assigned area. They must have in-depth knowledge of
            the situation and the context in the area they handle.
        </p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>RES Safety Committee – Council consisting of 10 almost completely anonymous people, responsible
            for the most important decisions related to the RES and its objects. Decision presented by one
            committee member are accepted if more than half of the committee agrees with the decision. Every
            member of committee is equal to each other, and nobody is higher than anyone. Shortened version
            of the committee title – “RSC”.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>“Caryatide” - The anonymous administrator of RES. The only known fact that persona is a woman.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Object classes and numbers</p>
        <p>Object classes are:</p>
        <p>Haven - Objects that are easily and safely contained. Well researched.</p>
        <p>Haphazard – Objects that are insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable.</p>
        <p>Sephirot – Objects that are exceedingly difficult to contain and most of the times dangerous.</p>
        <p>Cezar – Objects that are world-ending threats.</p>
        <p>Neutralized – Objects that are destroyed or lost their anomaly.</p>
        <p>There may be classes that are not in this list.</p>
        <p>Numbers of anomalous objects mostly random, but researcher can always choose, of course, if
            number is not busy by another object.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Sites and areas.</p>
        <p>Area – a large RES facility, where contains a few or many objects.
            Site – a building, that mainly built around an object and contains an object that cannot be physically
            or in any way be placed in any Area.
        </p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>RES-AMNESIA</p>
        <p>RES is own production agent that helps to get rid of ones, who became witnesses of anomaly activity
            by cleaning their memory. It has three types – AMNESIA Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3. Each one is
            different by memory period, that they clean – 1 day, 1 week, 1 month. But using them without
            instructions may lead subject to coma and mental damage. Important – using two AMNESIA Type-3
            at the same time will not clean 2 months of memory period and will have consequences.</p>

    <p>ㅤ</p>
    <p>Here are the first 5 Foundation's objects (The first 5 objects are free to read)</p>
    <details>
        <summary>RES-001 — “Incomprehension feelings”</summary>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>RES-001</p>
        <p>Object class: Cezar</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Containment Procedures: Due to object’s natural feature it’s yet uncontainable because of its speed
            and unpredictability. All object’s activity should be monitored across the world by Foundation’s
            agents. Every information must be sent to head of task force “Helluva Fire”, to collect more
            information about object and eliminate it, if there is a need. If there is any opportunity to stop
            object, withdrawing task force “Helluva Fire” is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Any information about the existence of RES-001 in the media must be immediately removed or
            reliably falsified. The person who somehow witnessed the object must be taken away to Site-1, the
            highly classified and strongest containment chamber to hold down RES-001 and interrogate RES-001-
            1 (the object’s “victims”) about what they saw and know. After the interrogation every subject must
            get dose of RES-AMNESIA, the type of which depends on the time period, object was witnessed.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>At the time of writing this document, RES-001 apparently does not appear to have committed any
            kills or caused serious damage to any buildings or infrastructure. But because of its speed, risk of
            above listed catastrophes is very high.
        </p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>The only information source were the people, who witnessed the RES-001 and because of this, all
            the information documented about the object may not be accurate. All that remains is to believe the
            words of witnesses and RES-001-1, because object was never caught on camera yet.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>Description: RES-001 is an object, that’s appearance is impossible to describe correctly, because of
            “poverty of human abilities and its language”, as describes him the one of only two specimens of
            RES-001-1. Some of the workers of RES from around the world has glimpsed possibly RES-001 in the
            sky, but no one of them all could not tell, what color or shape was the object. They explain that none
            of existing colors are matching color of RES-001, not even a bit. Only “useful” and coincidence of
            opinions of all workers was that object is fast as some fighter jet, and maybe even faster.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>There were already rumors about the RES-001 in the nineties among Special Division [DATA
            REDACTED], Task Force “Shattered Clock” and Agent Mikkelsen, but no one paid much attention to
            it, even they themselves. First RES-001-1 became known in 2005, February 13, and was found in
            village Burford, England. Person was crying endless and was mumbling everyone around about
            “feeling of déjà vu", “ending his suffer”, but also contradicted saying about “euphoria” subject is
            constantly feeling.
        </p>

        <p>RES-001-1 First Interrogation</p>
        <p>2005, February 14</p>
        <p>CF-001001 as RES-001-1</p>
        <p>- The subject constantly wet himself and moaning in his containment room.</p>
        <p>- No useful information.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>The second RES-001-1 was found at Torre del Mar, Spain. Subject was a 26 years old cook
            Christopher Rodney, American tourist. Subject attracted the attention of the people by shouting
            every morning from the roof of the building “Destiny angel, the only decisive one!”.</p>
        <p>ㅤ</p>
        <p>RES-001-1 Second Interrogation</p>
        <p>2005, March 2</p>
        <p>CF-001002 as RES-001-1</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: These freaks again... Alright, straight to the point, will you explain to me, what the fuck is
            going on there.</p>
        <p>CF-001002: A world is going on, sir!</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: What? Like I said.
        </p>
        <p>CF-001002: Every time I try to explain myself to someone, they think I’m nuts! Only I understand it. Its
            flow. Its intentions. It will bring a heaven to us! Right here and everywhere!</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: Hey, hey, hey, I’m an anomaly researching professor, not just a guy, so explain it to me.</p>
        <p>CF-001002: You too think I have gone crazy, right? No, I just have wide open eyes, instead of you all.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: Explain every shit you just told me. No mumbling.
        </p>
        <p>CF-001002: There is no need such think as explanation, because we all don’t need it. You all can’t do
            anything to stop it or our fate. Only it knows and it controls it, so as it did the past timelines and will
            do it in future timelines.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: The fuck is all these “its-es” and timelines?</p>
        <p>CF-001002: By it I mean that flying angel. And by the timelines I mean the start of the time and end
            of it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: Oh, so you call it “angel”. Since when do you know its shape?</p>
        <p>CF-001002: It doesn’t look like angel literally, just a nickname by me. Let me continue. The reason
            why are we here is because it wanted this, and if it ever will get caught, then it wanted to be caught.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: And how do you know all that? The angel came down from heaven and whispered in
            your ears?</p>
        <p>CF-001002: I don’t quite understand, why are you so mean, but that’s all my theory.
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: Because you keep defending that bastard, who killed hundreds of people last month.</p>
        <p>CF-001002: Then maybe that’s right, ‘cause... Do you know what is butterfly effect? Sure these
            people died for better future. In the future timelines.</p>
        <p>[Silence]</p>
        <p>Dr. Nathan: Somehow you managed to convince me to... You know. And that thing about deaths of
            hundred people - I made It up. Don’t fool your head with that. I will save your assumptions.

        <summary>RES-002 — “Skittish”</summary>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RES-002</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Object class: Sephirot</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Containment Procedures: Currently, RES-002 is kept in an ordinary stone house, equipped with 
            tracking devices in hybrid version of Site-2 with specific conditions of containment, located in the 
            village of Bulnes (the Site occupies 1/3 km² of the entire area of the village), Spain. Entrance to the 
            Site is closed to civilians or villagers of Bulnes. At the Foundation's request, Site-2 has been hidden 
            from all satellite maps. Flights over the Site are also prohibited.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>According to the protocol, Site-2 should look like an ordinary village, with residents living inside for a 
            long time. The village must also be attended by at least 20 trained and experienced employees 
            (hereinafter referred to as RES-002-1 - RES-002-20), pretending to be residents of the village. Only 
            they are allowed to contact with object.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the village, physical or any harm to employees and the RES-002 itself, the presence of any 
            “mysterious looking” vehicles, any dogs, living cows, horses and wild animals are prohibited. If the 
            animals listed earlier enter the Site, the animal must be taken far out of the Area or silently 
            eliminated staying out of object’s sight. It is also forbidden to talk to RES-002 about topics, which 
            may cause discomfort, stress or fear in the object.
            </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Description: RES-002 is a 13-year-old girl, named [DATA REDACTED], came from Sardinia, Italy. She 
            has an Italian appearance, with ash-colored hair, and is approximately 155 cm tall. The subject has 
            several minor scars and bruises on her arms and legs. In the Site-2, employees call her “Ashley”, 
            because of her appearance and her reluctance to say her real name.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RES-002's biography states that the object's 47-year-old biological father, [CLASSIFIED], has a history 
            of several domestic violence. The mother, in turn, was accused of petty theft. RES-002 lived with her 
            both parents until she got to Spain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RES-002 was found by Foundation personnel and finally "caught" in the village of Bulnes, where she 
            appeared to be seeking peace. It is speculated that the essence of the object's anomalous ability is 
            that when RES-002 senses fear or danger, the object appears to accidentally (or instinctively) kill a 
            random person nearby, and the whole accident seems to be an incident. In the murders she herself, 
            perhaps a random third person, surrounding things are included and all together work as a chain of 
            events, accidents (where one thing leads to the other), and at first glance it looks like bad luck. Also, 
            after the murder, the object immediately begins to cry and panic, and in most cases, successfully 
            escape from the scene (see below Chronology).
            </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Chronology</p>
        <p>06/10/2011. 09:12 — RES-002 runs out of her former house, where will her neighbor be found dead, 
            due to electric shock when repairing a broken outlet.
            </p>
        <p>06/10/2011. 9:14 – RES-002 runs out of the house wearing a white plaid shirt, gray jeans and a beige 
            coat. Probably, she was running towards the nearest hospital. Streets were empty.</p>
        <p>06/10/2011. 9:15 — Afterwards, RES-002, for an unknown reason, changed its route and turned into 
            an alley. Due to the lack of cameras on the streets into which the object ran, it is unknown what 
            happened next.</p>
        <p>06/10/2011. 9:28. - RES-002 was seen running on the street [DATA REDACTED], where 5 minutes 
            after the object's presence nearby, the restaurant [DATA REDACTED] was caught in fire, despite the 
            fact that the object did not stop anywhere, although there were few people on the streets. RES-002 
            disappeared from view again.
            </p>
        <p>06/10/2011. 15:01. - According to witnesses, RES-002 entered the nearest to her house forest.</p>
        <p>06/10/2011. 16:50. - Information was received that a beige coat was found in the forest where RES002 was. The object itself was not found. RES-002 was put on the wanted list by the lo</p>
        <p>07/10/2011. 06:34. - In Toulouse, France, on the highway [DATA REDACTED], a red Renault car was 
            found burnt out and collided with a tree. Inside, they found the burned body of a 48-year-old 
            woman named Rikiel Flis, as well as the fingerprints of RES-002. On the backseat there was found 
            suitcase containing Rikiel's belongings, food, [DATA REDACTED] and a set of knives were also found 
            in the car (the knives may have been the reason she was found dead).</p>
    <p>08/10/2011. 10:27. - Residents of the village of Bulnes found RES-002 crying near one of the houses.</p>
    <p>08/10/2011. 12:04. - Foundation employees arrived in the village and seized part of it for the 
        construction of Site-2. Afterwards, RES-AMNESIA was used on all residents of Bulnes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After the arrival of Foundation personnel, RES-002 was given a separate house, which is essentially 
        considered her holding cell. The object's containment chamber did not differ in any way from 
        ordinary houses in appearance, which should not arouse any suspicion in RES-002.

        <summary>RES-003 — "The paradoxical document”</summary>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RES-003</p>
        <p>Object class: Haphazard</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Containment Procedures: RES-003 must be stored in a fireproof metal safe. The containment room 
            and safe must be under constant surveillance. Entering the containment chamber or opening the 
            safe without express permission is strictly prohibited. Entry into the chamber is permitted only for 
            regular cleaning and checking the condition of the chamber.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Description: RES-003 looks like a regular document containing information about RES-003. 
            Outwardly, it is not particularly different from other documents that includes information about the 
            Foundation’s objects. Possibly, RES-003 is this document. Because of what the object is, this requires 
            careful handling of the object.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Object was found at the desk of Dr. Russell, but neither Russell, nor any of the writers, nor any of the 
            researchers know where the document came from. There were no fingerprints on the paper (the 
            RES-003), except the Dr. Russel’s ones. Yet no one has deleted the RES-003 from the database.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dr. Russel got down to objects anyway. Having spent several days, figuring out where this object 
            came from and what its essence was, Dr. Russel came to the conclusion to begin to consider the 
            object as a psychic attack from an unknown.
            </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Note: Attention! This note was written after the object was found and was not part of it before it was 
            found by Dr. Russel. Despite this, what was written above is true, although again it is unknown who is 
            the author of this document is and where all the information was taken from. And Dr. Russel actually 
            found the document on his desk.</p>

            <p>Containment Procedures: Since the object appears to be written on a police box, the entire police 
                box had to be transported to Site 139. The size of the object's containment room must be at least 
                10x10x10 meters. The police box (hereinafter referred to as RES-004-1) is covered with fabric, and 
                removal of the fabric without permission is prohibited. In order to avoid unwanted incidents 
                associated with the fall of the fabric, it was nailed to the floor.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The security camera must be positioned so that RES-004 is not visible, if fabric that covers it will be 
                torn. For the same reason, the police box cannot be moved or turned the other way.
                </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Description: RES-004 is an outwardly ordinary text written in red spray paint. The entire text is 1 and 
                a half meters long. RES-004-1 on which object is located does not have any anomalous properties 
                and is just a police box. According to some local residents, they had not seen RES-004 before and it 
                appeared exactly later than December 15th, 2013. and they also did not see who, more likely, wrote 
                the text on that police box. But examination of the soils shows that RES-004-1 has been at the place 
                where it was found for more than a decade.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>RES-004-1 has the following text (the object): “Should a person be punished for accidentally killing 5 
                people and then accidentally losing his memory?”. In this version of quote some words have been 
                changed to their synonym to avoid an anomalous effect, but it is unknown, if the effect even can 
                transfer to a new medium, in this case this document, but the phrase has not been significantly 
                changed to avoid changing the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the event that a subject who knows English, can read and understand the entire meaning of the 
                text, then the subject after reading (Hereinafter as RES-004-2) will become less confident in his own 
                or someone else’s actions. It looks clearly from the outside. RES-004-2 begins to doubt the 
                correctness of each of his decisions or movements, asking himself from within. For example, the 
                question: “Am I doing it right?” These decisions include such things as: choosing one or more items 
                over others; the answer to a mathematical equation (the subject rechecks the answer a bunch of 
                times without ultimately arriving at a final answer); the correctness and morality of any decisions, 
                regardless of who proposed the decision; choosing the right words to express something (there were 
                cases when RES-004-2 were completely silent, unable to find the right words to say or answer); 
                feeling of lack of confidence in yourself or someone; difficulty keeping focus on one thing; feeling of 
                "fog" in the head. This effect becomes stronger every day, and the effect can spread to other organs 
                of the body, such as the lungs, which can ultimately lead to suffocation. A logical answer to the last 
                one was not found.</p>

        <summary>RES-005 — “Teddy’s fault”
        </summary>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RES-005</p>
        <p>Object class: Haphazard</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Containment Procedures: RES-005 must be contained in a glass box measuring 1x1x1 meters, with a 
            door with a secret code. The secret code is kept in Dr. Baritone’s cabinet. The glass box itself must be 
            stored in a constantly guarded chamber equipped with CCTV cameras. But after numerous 
            complaints about a feeling of paranoia due to eye contact with the RES-005, it was decided to 
            replace the previously set camera mode (constantly recording) with a mode that alerts when motion 
            is detected. The objects chamber must be guarded by at least 2 guards.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the object guards or employees passing by the cell hear any strange sounds, then they should 
            simply ignore them. If extraneous sounds are heard too often, the employee is advised to contact 
            the psychiatric department in the Site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Description: RES-005 is a black teddy bear, weighing exactly 226 grams and measuring 19x12x16 
            centimeters. Inside and out, it is not very different from ordinary soft toys. The entire body of the 
            toy is made of black fabric, the paws are made of gray, and the muzzle is made of white color plastic. 
            The eyes of the toy are made of ordinary resin, but the detailing and “realism” of the eyes are very 
            similar to human ones. The toy's mouth smiles slightly, and as many CF-class employees describe, it 
            is very alarming.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So far, there have never been any recorded cases or incidents associated with RES-005 that could 
            attribute anomalous properties to the object, other than a constant feeling of anxiety. Because of 
            this reason, a decision is still being considered to change the object class to Haven, or simply 
            completely remove RES-005 from the list of anomalous RES objects.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The object was transported to Site-173 from the Norwood, Massachusetts police station. Police 
            arrived at the house at [CLASSIFIED] after a call from a boy, by the name Chris Godfrey, who 
            reported that there was a murder in his house. In the recording of the call, only Chris's desperate 
            voice can be heard, announcing that his plush toy killed the boy's stepfather. In the recording, 
            according to the operator’s reaction, the man took Chris seriously, and after listening to the boy, he 
            immediately sent for help. There was indeed a dead man lying on the floor at the scene, with 
            wounds from a kitchen knife on his neck and both legs. The blood-covered knife itself lay near the 
            paws of a teddy bear, which was in a sitting position not far from the corpse. Absolutely all police 
            officers, for some reason, were sure that a teddy bear had committed the crime, or just had 
            suspicions. The police officers, without conducting any investigations, made a unanimous decision. 
            The toy was confiscated by the police, and then “fell into the hands of the Foundation.”
            </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boy lived with his stepfather, and the mother died a year after the boy was born. After a short 
            conversation with Chris about the situation, the boy spoke about his stepfather’s “terrible behavior”, 
            but it was not possible to get much useful information, except for the boy’s last words before the 
            end of the conversation, which were: “I just want to believe that he did it.”</p>
